# SignalScribe color highlighting example
# ---------------------------------------
#
# Supported color names can be found here: https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/appendix/colors.html
#
# You can add additional highlight colors by adding the name with a colon after it, like "orange4:"
# Add new items to be highlighted by prefixing them with a hyphen and a space, like "- shots fired"
#
# Highlights take precedence the higher up in a file they are.
# For instance 'one' will be highlighted green, despite the fact that it's also included under 'blue:', because green comes higher up in the file than blue.
#
# Highlighting is case insensitive, so Thirteen, THIRTEEN and thirteen will all be highlighted purple according to this example
# 
# Highlighting happens by phrase, rather than by word. So 'five six seven' will be highlighted only if all 3 words occur together
